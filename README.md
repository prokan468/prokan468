- 👋 Hi, I’m @prokan468
- 👀 I’m proficient in programming languages such as Java, Python, CPP. I am keen to learn more languages as the idea of conversion of lines of code to an action gives me a sense of thrill.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Google's Go Language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on repositories based on data structures and algorithms and new Python Modules.
- 📫 You can reach me on my mail- 2kanishk9@gmail.com
